We need to sort the transparent objects from 
"back" to "front" ("farthest from camera to closest")

Here's The Plan:
* Draw all the NON-transparent objects 
	NOT < 1.0f
* Sort the TRANSPARENT objects from Farthest to nearest
	alpha < 1.0f
	
	float distToCamera = glm::distance( pObject->position - g_cameraEye );
	
	- Or 
	
	glm::vec3 objectToCameraRay = pObject->position - g_cameraEye;
	float distToCamera = glm::length(objectToCameraRay);
